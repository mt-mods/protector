Protector Tool

Can be crafted with a protector surrounded by steel ingots and is used to place new protectors at a set distance of protector.radius in all directions including up and down simply by looking in a direction.

Use by standing near an existing protector, looking in a direction and using as a tool, hold sneak/shift to place new protector containing member list from inside nearest one.
